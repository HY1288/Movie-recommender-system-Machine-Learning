# Movie-recommender-system-Machine-Learning


Background
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.



Types of Recommender Systems:-

1. CONTENT BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM--> content suggested on the basis of content similarity, here tags are created and recommendations are made on the basis of those tags. 
ex- recommendations with tagline "products/movies Suggested for you"

2. COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM--> content is recommended on the basis of user's interest and behaviour (identify two users with similar interest choices taste and recommend them each other's choices. 
ex- recommendations with taglines- "users who watched/purchased this also watched/purchased this"

3. HYBRID RECOMMENDER SYSTEM--> is the mix of both, recommendations are based on content as well as collaborative filtering.




In the current project we will be building a content based recommender system which will recommend movies on the basis of content relevance/similarity.



PROJECT Overview / Flow

1. Starting with data preprocessing
2. Build a Machine learning model
3. Create a website interface for the model created
4. Deploy the website



DATASET-->
sources from Kaggle named as "tmdb_5000_movies", data is in two files "tmdb_5000_credits" and "tmdb_5000_movies".
